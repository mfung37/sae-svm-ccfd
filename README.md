# SAE-SVM Credit Card Fraud Detection
Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) with SVM for credit card fraud detection

Replicating work from [Honlam Li's paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3573428.3573650).

## Usage
Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud 
```bash
unzip archive.zip
```
You get a `creditcard.csv` file and put in the root of the repo.

Run Jupyter notebook and you should be able to run everything in the file. 
On google colab, the code took 35-40 minutes to complete.
